/**
 * Fancy ring to focus on Items.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * These steps set up a FocusRing component and associates it with a reference. This reference is then used by the setFocusRing function and the focus manager to set the focus ring to the current activeElement.
 * #### 1. Necessary imports:
 *
 * - `useFocusManager`: an Effect used to manage focus within the application. See more on `useFocusManager` [here](https://lightning-tv.github.io/solid/#/primitives/useFocusManager?id=usefocusmanager-for-key-handling).
 * - `onMount`: This lifecyle is used to run code after the component has mounted.
 * - `setFocusRing`: This function in the FocusRing package is used to set the FocusRing reference and position the component on the current `activeElement`.
 * - `FocusRing` : The FocusRing itself.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { onMount } from 'solid-js';
 * import { useFocusManager } from '@lightningtv/solid/primitives';
 * import { FocusRing, setFocusRing } from '@lightningtv/solid-ui';
 * ```
 * #### 2. Create a ref:
 * Declare an empty variable that will be used to store a reference to the `FocusRing` component. For example `let focusRef;`
 *
 * #### 3. Use the focus manager:
 * Use the focus manager (`useFocusManager();`) Effect to activate focus management.
 *
 * #### 4. Use the FocusRing reference after the components are rendered:
 * This code runs after the component has mounted. It calls the `setFocusRing` function to position the FocusRing to the current `activeElement` using the ref variable.
 *
 * ```js
 * onMount(() => {
 *    setFocusRing(focusRef);
 * });
 * ```
 * #### 5. Render the FocusRing component and use the declared reference variable:
 * This line renders the `FocusRing` component, passing `focusRef` as a prop. This allows the `setFocusRing` function to associate the FocusRing with the component instance.
 *
 * ```js
 * <FocusRing ref={focusRef} />
 * ```
 * ## Example usage
 *
 * ```js
 * import { View } from '@lightningtv/solid';
 * import { onMount } from 'solid-js';
 * import { useFocusManager } from '@lightningtv/solid/primitives';
 * import { Button, FocusRing, setFocusRing } from '@lightningtv/solid-ui';
 *
 * const App = () => {
 *  let focusRef;            // Declared reference variables
 *  useFocusManager();       // Effect that manages focus
 *
 *  onMount(() => {          // Function that runs after components are mounted
 *    setFocusRing(focusRef);// Sets rings location to the current focused element
 *  });
 *
 *  return (
 *    <View>
 *      <FocusRing ref={focusRef} /> // Passing the ref variable as a ref prop
 *      // Other components that receive focus
 *      <Button autofocus width={100}> 1 </Button>
 *      <Button width={100}> 2 </Button>
 *    </View>
 *  );
 * };
 *
 * export default App;
 * ```
